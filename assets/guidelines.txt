This are the guidelines for the test.

All prizes must be sorted.

- You start assigning from the highest.

- The first winner gets the highest prize.

- Then the prize is reduced as we proceed.

- If the prizes are more than the winners, you start assigning the prize from the one that has the least. The one that has the least is awarded more.


For example consider the following example:

Kamau -> 1000,300 = 1300
Jane -> 900,400 = 1300
Joyce -> 800,500,100 = 1400
Martin -> 700,600,200 = 1500
